Generative stuff, possibly viewable here: https://vimeo.com/dizzypete/videos

curlgrid
--------

A simple demo app showing some details about curl noise

gpu curl 2D/3D
--------------

More demos apps, this time using the GPU for particle advection and curl generation

parallel_reduction 
------------------

parallel_reduction is an example of using the GPU to process data stored in
textures. This is a simple example that calculates the average value of the
red channel.

noise1
------

messing around with fractional sums of Perlin noise

ARK
---

ARK is an example of using an fbo as a texture on a mesh. It sprang out
of a forum discussion so has at least 3 different people touching it, but
hopefully should be clear enough.
